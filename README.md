# Advanced Emergency Vehicle Detection using Sound Localization
This prototype builds on current system of incoming emergency vehicle detection at intersection by adding a direction parameter for effective management of traffic.This prototype uses an array of microphones and LED bulbs to display the direction of incoming vehicle.These microphones receive the same sound but at different intervals of time.Sound captured by the microphone is sampled and filtered. Angle of the receiving soundwave that corresponds to the frequency of the emergency vehicleâ€™s siren determines the direction of the corresponding soundwave and LEDs are lit up accordingly.

Hardware Requirements:<br/>
FRDM K64f<br/>
